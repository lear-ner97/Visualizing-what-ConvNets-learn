# Visualizing-what-ConvNets-learn
We look into what sort of visual patterns image classification models learn. We'll be using the ResNet50V2 model, trained on the ImageNet dataset.  Our process is simple: we will create input images that maximize the activation of specific filters in a target layer. Such images represent a visualization of the pattern that the filter responds to.
